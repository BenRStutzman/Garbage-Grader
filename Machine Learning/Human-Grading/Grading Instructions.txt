Instructions for grading food waste pictures

I. Look at the picture and judge whether anything is being disposed at all.
    1. If nothing is being disposed (i.e. just people walking by, counter being
       wiped, trash bin being moved, no action at all in picture), give the grade
       of 'N' for 'not gradeable' and skip the remaining steps.
    2. If something is being disposed, continue to step II.
II. Estimate the total volume (in cups) of AVOIDABLE waste in the picture.
    1. This includes combining waste from multiple plates, multiple people,
       liquids, stuff that shouldn't even be composted, etc.
    2. This does not include things like fruit peels and chicken bones, and
       up to one napkin per picture (i.e. everyone gets one 'free' napkin
       before it starts counting as waste)
III. If the total volume of avoidable waste is X, judge where it falls on this scale:

    A:            X  =   0 cups
    B:   0 cups < X <= 1/2 cup
    C: 1/2 cup  < X <=   1 cup
    D:   1 cup  < X <=   2 cups
    F:   2 cups < X

    Tips: 1/2 cup is about the size of a hockey puck.
            1 cup is about the size of a baseball.

    Give the corresponding letter grade.

IV. If you are confused and think this picture presents something new that hasn't
    been considered (i.e. doesn't fall under N, A, B, C, D, or F), give a longer
    message explaining your confusion instead of a grade.
